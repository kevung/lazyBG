Edit panel, define workflow

Undo/redo should work also in Edit panel

Clean message info in status bar


Should be able to search
Double: "d"
Pass "p"
Take "t"
Cannot move "f"
update both search panel and command line query

If Edit mode and move panel is closed, if user enter new dice value or cube decision after after having cycled between candidate move, it should valdate the checker move and edit the next decision. No need to press enter. If enter f for checker move, it validates the checker move and edit the next move.

Undo/Redo in Edit mode with close move panel should work

Detect move candidate from defined checker move 

Insert before/after decision
Delete decision
with move panel closed
Contextual menu on the board

Why player1 displays move though empty decision, after having browser player2 decision. Edge effect

Coherence control, dice value but with no checker move. If it is not last move, it cannot be a resign.

Erase dice with backspace. If so, erase any checker move
